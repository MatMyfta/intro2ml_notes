# A short introduction to Machine Learning

This repository contains my personal notes about the course Introduction to Machine Learning of University of Trento.

## Structure

All the utils of the project are collected into the principal file, called [ml.pdf](ml.pdf). The folders are organized as follows:

- [chapters](chapters/) contains the .tex file for each chapter.
  - In each chapter there is a final part that contains exercises, open questions, the questions that contains the '!' symbol are the ones that have been asked in the previous exams.
- [img](img/) contains all the images files of the project.
